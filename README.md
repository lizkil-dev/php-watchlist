# Movie Watchlist
A watchlist built with PHP and MySQL to keep track of all the movies I still want to watch.

## Demo
[screen-capture.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102907651/191039397-8952f612-3275-49ac-9a7c-d4465d9eb875.webm)

## Requirements
PHP 5.3 or higher recommended  
MySQL DB

## Installation
• Upload php-watchlist to the directory of your choice. (E.g : /var/www/html/php-watchlist)  
• Import MySql Db file to your database software (E.g : PhpMyAdmin -> Create DB -> Import moviedb.sql )  
• Configure connection between your database and server by modifying the index.php file  
• Navigate to the installation in your browser ( E.g : http://localhost/php-watchlist )  
Done :)

## Main Features
• Login/Logout: The list can only be updated after login  
• CRUD functionalities: Allows the user to create, read, update and delete the movies and single details of the movies in a managed format  

## Improvements
I still need to add a search functionality where you can search names, genres or tags and sort the movielist accordingly.
