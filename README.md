# College-Notes-Gallery
A watchlist built with PHP and MySQL to keep track of all the movies I still want to watch.

## Demo

## Requirements
PHP 5.3 or higher recommended
MySQL DB

## Login Details
User: Lisa
Password: Lustig

## Main Features
Login/Logout: The list can only be updated after login
CRUD functionalities: Allows the user to create, read, update and delete the movies and single details of the movies in a managed format

## Improvements
I still need to add a search functionality where you can search and for certain names, genres or tags and sort the movies accordingly.
